# **Executive Summary**


## **Internet Architecture**
A. An IP address is an Internet protocol Address. it is a unique number assigned to computers or other devices that connect to the internet.
The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is IPv4 was the original internet protocol and after so many years of expansion the pool of addresses has been used up Whihc is when IPv6 came about.IPv6 having a massively larger address pool(340 undecillion).

C. ICANN is the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority(IANA) and distributes IPs to Regional Internet Registrates around the world.

### **TCP/IP** 
A. TCP/IP(Transmissions Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol has the responsibility or purpose of connecting computer systems to each other through a global network. 
It is designed that each computer or device in a network has an IP and that IP can communicate with up to 65535 different ports from other network devices.

B. The client is the computer or device that dials up and the server is the computer that is listening.The client needs the IP and the other just conncts or rejects.

C. 1. layers are important to changing protocols because while a single stack protocol is inflexible and to change anything would require rewriting the whole thing,
one with layers is much easier to work with... since most of the tasks and functions are broken up. So when changing something you dont have to rewrite it as a whole only that specific part. So as technology becomes increasingly more complex having multiple layers gives you the ability to focus on the parts you are maintaing and fixing, while saving you time and energy rewriting something.

2. The types of applications that run on the "application" layer are HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, and SNMP.

### ** Internet Security**
A.HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol. it supports the client server model by the you typing in whatever site address your computer "calls" up that location and waits for whatever server to pick up so that the information exchange can begin.

B. The protocols that secure HTTP uses (or HTTPS) to protect your data is with SSL(secure sockets layer) and TLS(Transport Layer Security) Not only does it scramble the data ( using Public Key Encryption) but it requires the website to identify itself an the computer will send its digital SSL certificate. TLS works in the same way as SSL and is based on the same specifications authenticating the server, client, and encrypts data.

### **Securing Your Web Browser**
A. You should secure your web browser because of the frequency they are used an if not secure leaves you open to Spyware or having someone else take control of your computer.
B. One of the risks you could be exposed to is Spyware which can be put on your computer unbeknownst to you if you do not have security in place. it would allow the intruder to spy on what you do and type compromisng everything on your PC.
## **HTML5 AND CSS**

### **Internet Programming**
A. Tim Berners-Lee was an inventor of the World Wide Web.. he even coined the term. An wrote the first server as "Httpd". 
He created "W3C"( The World Wide Web Consortium) for the creation of Web standards to help maintain the "culture of global participation and development" of the Web.

B. The standard I choice is Web Design and Applications and its important because it involves building and rendering webpages. Using alot of the common things we use today HTML,CSS,SVG and APIs. It also helps with making websites accessible to those with disabilities and spreads it all internationally.. Without any of this it would be hard to imagine the web being.. well "The Web".
