#**Excecutive Summary**
In this chapter we will cover hardware memory and various components that have to do with data transfer. An the input that the 
computer takes to represent data

##**Hardware**
###Hard drives and Memory

Latency and Transfer rates are important because they can directly impact the speed of your computers processing with the time it takes 
to go back get and prepare the information requested. 

Latency-Latencies are usually described in milliseconds and is the average time it takes for a section to be accessed 
and for the disk to rotate into position.
Transfer Rates- Also known as media rate is the speed in which data is tranferred to and from the disk. Its described as 
Megabytes per seconds.

SSD or Solid State Hard Drives is almost like it sounds. It uses Solid State Memory to store data. What makes it different from a traditional 
harddrive is the lack of moving parts so it cuts down on time and you dont have to worry so much about dust or other foreign debris hindering
the disks preformance.

####RAM- 
Also known as Random Access Memory allows for you to temporarily store information on the board in memory modules which allows 
your computer to load information faster without constantly having to go back to the harddrive.

64 & 32 bit is how much data a computer can tranfer at a time. Each bit representing 8 bytes so essentially the 64 bit is twice as fast 
as the 32 bit.

####ALU and the Control Unit-
The control unit takes instruction from RAM and breaks it down for other parts of the computer. Once the computer gets
the information and sends it back depending on the required info the control unit will then decide what happens with the info.. be it displayed 
or otherwise.
ALU is the Arithmatic Logic Unit and does all the mathmatical computation inside of the computer. 
The ram gives info to the Control unit and the control unit gives the math component to the ALU and tells it what to preform and the ALU
then sends out the answer. 
Ram->Control Unit->ALU


####CPU memory-
The Central Processing Unit(CPU) is pretty much the brain of the motherboard.This is where information can be stored til it 
outputs it. It receives the information stores/processes it and then out puts it in the way requested.. hopefully.

input->store->process->output->

####Input & Output- 
Is along the lines of how data is sent and received.. you can send(input) data using an external device
or show(output) data using another external device. The most basic of examples is your keyboard in which you use to input
the data and your monitor that is used to show(output) the corresponding data.

####Logic Gates and Circuits- 
Logic gates store info(numerical) through circuits and currents called logic gates. You would use 
something called Truth Table to show the possible results of how the logic gate would take the each part of the desired input and
show all the possible outcomes. 
The major differences between an AND gate and a NAND gate is an AND table will only let the information through if they both meet
the criteria. If they are both ones it will display a one if both zero that shall display too.... But if one of the one inputs happen
to be a zero the other a one it will only display zero.
Now an NAND is like its evil doppleganger it does pretty much the same but only in reverse. If both outputs are ones it will display a zero.
If both out puts are zeros it will display a one.Also in this case if you have a mix match input of a one and a zero it will still do the 
opposite of a AND and show a one rather than a zero.

####IEEE- 
Is a association designed to advance innovation and technology for the benefit of mankind. It stands for the Institue of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers. The importance of ethics in design is to have you thinking about about the impact that you will be making by your contribution
to whatever project. Since each part of the system is in fact made by a person it makes you as well as the company involved accountable for what
the AI does or is used for.

##**Data Representation**
###Numeric Conversions
####Decimal- 
Decimal is a base 10 system that everytime you move over to the left you multiply by 10.
each spot representing a new group of tens.... like with 152. The two representing one 2, the five representing five 10s and lastly
the one representing ten 10s and so on.
####Binary-
Binary is a base two system and how our computers work.. the only symbols used are 0 and 1 and it calculates by powers of 2.
counts as 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1
####Hexadecimal- 
Hexadecimal also known as the base 16 system is like the base 10 system but also includes six letters that extend it to sixteen spots 
counting like 0123456789ABCDEF. The last 6 spots counting as 10,11,12,13,14, and 15
