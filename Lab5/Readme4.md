# **Executive Summary**

## **Lucidchart**
This was my first experience with Lucid art but not my first with flow charts... I don't typically mind writing things down..
But I do feel like this makes things neater looking and more organized. I will probably have to check this out more thoroughly later.

## **Introduction to Networking**
### **Data Transmission**
**Packet** - Is 2. A unit of data.
Packet matches and is related to a "unit of data" because that is essentially what it is. It is the fundamental unit of data transmitted over the internet. 
Making it pretty much the information broken down and sent/received.

**Packet-Switching** - 4. Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address.
This term matches and is related by the use of a router, which is a device recieves packets of info and then sends them to their destinations.

**IP Address** - 3. Unique identifying number.
An IP address is the identifying number it is the address of whatever device you have connected to the internet.

**DNS** - 5. Directory of IP address common names.
Meaning "Domain Name Server or System..Is a directory of internet websites and returns IP addresses to youu of the host requested.

**Protocol** - 1. Set rules to allow devices to communicate.
Is literally the rules set to govern how network communications take place.


### **NetworkHardware**
**A.** Hubs are not intelligent and can not filter data they only know when a device is connected and copies the data to all ports.
A switch though similar is intelligent an can learn the addresses of devices connected to it and sends the data only to the correct port instead of all.
**B.** Hubs and switches can only send data to their own networks and cannot read IP addresses, unlike a router which can determine if data is for its network or another network.

### **Network Topologies**
**A.** Single point of failure means if the switch or main hub fails the whole network will fail. The topologies that experience this is Star Topologies.
**B.** A infastructure wireless topology connects the switch to a wireless access point. Also you can connect as many wireless access points that you need. 
A wireless mesh topology allows you to connect your wireless access point to other wireless access points without having to run extra cords and are all talking to eachother and does not matter if one goes out because they will simply reroute. Making it the superior topology.
