# **Executive Summary**
Today we are looking into file compression and object oriented programming.

## **File Compression**
A. The purpose of file compression is to allow you to send groups of files in less time and it makes it easier to download and recieve. 

B. When you look at the original file it is at 31 KB but when you compress it, it goes down to about 25.3 KB.. Which is pretty different than when I compared it with a JPG.
The file stayed about the same size. Im not sure completely why, but I believe the file is already at the size it can be at without ruining the quality.

## **Object Oriented Programming**

### **Python OOP**
1.The methods are swim(), __init__ , and be_awesome() and the property would be print("the shark is swimming") or ("the shark is being awesome")
2.A cosntructor method is used to initialize data.
3.A class defines a set of attributes that characterize an object being instantiated from the class.
 While an object is an instance of a class. "Intantiate an object from class" is creating an instance from the object in the class.

## **Object Oriented Concepts**

1.If I was going through a drive thru and I wanted to order the burger menu would be the class... The function would be me ordering and the object would be whatever burger I was choosing to get.

2.class-definition of a shark object(because the class defines what you know )
abstraction-shark (abstraction would be the behavior of the entity)
encapsulation-to:swim(self) (encapsulation is the methods and things it can do)
inheritance-a specific type of shark (allows you to make new classes from existing ones. So multiple classes require specfication )
object-sammy (the object would be the shark Sammy)

# **Conclusion**
After file compression we went over OOP and of the various pieces used to make a working program and their definitions.
I find this to be a little touch an go even though Ive done this before...An I didnt find the ways they choose to try an help explain too helpful.
An would prefer other more clear definitions.
