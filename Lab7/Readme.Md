# **Executive Summary**


## **File Compression**
A. The purpose of file compression is to allow you to send groups of files in less time and it makes it easier to download and recieve. 


## **Object Oriented Programming**
When you look at the original file it is at 31 KB but when you compress it, it goes down to about 25.3 KB.. Which is pretty different than when I compared it with a JPG.
The file stayed about the same size. Im not sure completely why, but I believe the file is already at the size it can be at without ruining the quality.
