# **Executive Summary**


## **File Compression**
A. The purpose of file compression is to allow you to send groups of files in less time and it makes it easier to download and recieve. 

B. When you look at the original file it is at 31 KB but when you compress it, it goes down to about 25.3 KB.. Which is pretty different than when I compared it with a JPG.
The file stayed about the same size. Im not sure completely why, but I believe the file is already at the size it can be at without ruining the quality.

## **Object Oriented Programming**

### **Python OOP**
1.The methods are swim(), __init__ , and be_awesome() and the property would be print("the shark is swimming") or ("the shark is being awesome")
2.A cosntructor method is used to initialize data.
3.A class defines a set of attributes that characterize an object being instantiated from the class.
 While an object is an instance of a class. "Intantiate an object from class" is creating an instance from the object in the class.
