# **Executive Summary**
For this chapter we will be going over computer software. The types, differences and the roles it plays. 

### **Software**
**operation systems and applications** are the two main categories of software.. While applications do all the fun things like run databases 
help us surf the net, play games and etc..Operating systems are the software that allows you to interact with your computer to even do those things. Essentially 
bridging the gab between the hardware and user allowing them to interact. Like my Xbox is my hardware. I play games like Batman and Anthem on it. But for it to run
or for me to play them I interact with my xbox through its operating systems Hyper-V and Windows 10.

**Utility software** allows you to fix and modify different aspects of your computer. Malware is an example as well as various ones to patch minor issues in your current 
running computers OS. Mostly like computer patches... or software you use to customize and change OS layouts and workings of your computer.

**ERP** or Enterprise Resource Planning.. Aka Enterprise software was made with the purpose of consolidating an entire company with one program.You use it to cover all your business needs and if necessary purchase other modules for more targeted things your company needs. it brings an air of cohesiveness and organization to a company since everything since they also use a central database. A good example of this type of software is SQL Server. 

### **Virtualization**
Virtualization allows you to use a seperate OS and software in a contained program inside your current existing computer independent of everything else. 
The types of problems that can be solved with virtualization are physical servers or "single vendor IT stacks" that wouldnt allow the use of legacy apps on different hardware..
An under utilized hardware.

**Hypervisors**
Hypervisors seperate your actual resources from the virtual enviorment.They take your resources and divde them up for use for your Virtual enviorments.

### **Python**
**A.** What is meant by the "Pseudo-Code nature of python" is that Python is typically easy to read and uses a simple approach to its language.
Pseudocode is a "plain language description of steps in an algorithm or another system".

**B.** A compiled language is a language converted from its source langauge to that of your computer using a compiler. Where as an interpreted language
is that which doesnt need to be changed to binary. You run it directly from the source code. it then gets coverted internally into an intermediate called bytecodes and is then 
translated into the computers language.
