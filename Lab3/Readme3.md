# **Executive Summary**
For this chapter we will be going over computer software. The types, differences and the roles it plays. 

### **Software**
**operation systems and applications** are the two main categories of software.. While applications do all the fun things like run databases 
help us surf the net, play games and etc..Operating systems are the software that allows you to interact with your computer to even do those things. Essentially 
bridging the gab between the hardware and user allowing them to interact. Like my Xbox is my hardware. I play games like Batman and Anthem on it. But for it to run
or for me to play them I interact with my xbox through its operating systems Hyper-V and Windows 10.

**Utility software** allows you to fix and modify different aspects of your computer. Malware is an example as well as various ones to patch minor issues in your current 
running computers OS. Mostly like computer patches... or software you use to customize and change OS layouts and workings of your computer.

**ERP** or Enterprise Resource Planning.. Aka Enterprise software was made with the purpose of consolidating an entire company with one program.You use it to cover all your business needs and if necessary purchase other modules for more targeted things your company needs. it brings an air of cohesiveness and organization to a company since everything since they also use a central database. A good example of this type of software is SQL Server. 

### **Virtualization**
Virtualization allows you to use a seperate OS and software in a contained program inside your current existing computer independent of everything else. 
The types of problems that can be solved with virtualization are physical servers or "single vendor IT stacks" that wouldnt allow the use of legacy apps on different hardware..
An under utilized hardware.

**Hypervisors**
Hypervisors seperate your actual resources from the virtual enviorment.They take your resources and divde them up for use for your Virtual enviorments.

### **Python**
**A.** What is meant by the "Pseudo-Code nature of python" is that Python is typically easy to read and uses a simple approach to its language.
Pseudocode is a "plain language description of steps in an algorithm or another system".

**B.** A compiled language is a language converted from its source langauge to that of your computer using a compiler. Where as an interpreted language
is that which doesnt need to be changed to binary. You run it directly from the source code. it then gets coverted internally into an intermediate called bytecodes and is then 
translated into the computers language.

## **Career Exploration**
### **College Central**
Looking up computers and Information Technology it gave about ten basic jobs.
Computer Support Specialist, Web Developer, Network and Systems Admin, Computer Programmer, Computer Systems Analyst, Database Admin, Information Security Analyst, Software Developer, Computer Network Architect, and Computer & Information Research Scientists.
The pay moved from Computer Support Specialist- a median 54,760 to Computer Information Research Scientist- a median of 122,840.
Everything else somewhere in between with most of them Bachelors degrees except for Computer Support which was unnamed most likely due to varying requirements and Web Developers being an Associate and also earning a median of 73,760. Computer Scientist was a masters degree.

### **Certifications**
**CompTIA** (CySA+) A worforce certification that applies behavioral analytics to networks and devices for threat prevention and detection through Cyber security and monitoring 
**Cisco** A diverse list of multiple certifications covering everything from Entry level to Architect
**CISSP** Certified Information Systems Security Professional.. A certification designed to prove you can design, implement, and manage cybersecurity programs

**Mobile Application Development** A short term program with about 21 credits...Can also help with enteprenural endeavors and is stackable with Programming and Development Degree.
 **Web Application and Development** A short term program with around  24-25 credits.. Will help prepare students to work with various web based software.. An is also stackable with Programming and development degree.
 
### **Co-ops/Internships**
The benefits of Co-ops and internships is the hands on learning along with being exposed to a professional enviorment or atleast an enviorment of like minded individuals
so to better yourself and your learning.It can also help to introduce you to future employers or people to help get you in the door(networking).. For me to be ready for this I would want to polish up on everything I have learned go over what Im currently learning and spruce up my resume. Pretty much be ready to jump in with both feet and as prepared as I possibly can be.

### **Industry Associations /Student Organizations**
**A.CCDC** The Cybersecurity Club I believe joining them would be beneficial for computer savvy individuals who are going into a career in Cybersecurity. it would be a great way to get your name out there. work with leading technologies and to converse with various people in the field. Not only would this be a great addition to a resume
it also expresses how much the subject interests you as well as a great way to showcase your skills.

# **Conclusion**
In this chapter not only did we start learning about various types of software, we even touched on a little coding. Before going on to explore the type of education required to progress in this field.
