##  **Resume and Career building**


## **Research**
I would really like to possibly do a co-op, but due to time constraints and work Im opting for research.
I have a few ideas.. but I am leaning torwards Cryptology because I find it intriguing.Plus learning more about ciphers and algorithms would be nice.
So my plan is to start by getting the book "cracking codes with Python" since it seems to be user friendly use that as a good base and try to branch out from there to learn a little more indepthly an about how ciphers and such have changed over the years since what we went over.

If you have any thoughts or ideas or suggestions with this topic I would be happy to hear them.
