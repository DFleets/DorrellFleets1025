# **Executive Summary**
Todays goal is the study of data, database systems, SQL and ethics

## **Data,Information and Knowledge**
## **Relational Data**
I. Data is considered raw facts deviod of context, while informstion is data that has been processed and now has purpose and relevance. 
knowledge is a human belief or perception about those concepts and facts.

II.1. If I was to do a table for customer and orders.. I would do an Customer#ID and use their phone number as a unique identifier so I can keep track and an OrderID 
which would be preassigned numbers to the shipments. An those would be my primary keys
ex: CustomerID: 4403454723 OrderID: 120054

2.The customer and order table would be related by a products table that would connect the person who ordered to the product to the shipment.


3. What would be the foreign key in the orders table would be a productID. like if the orderID is a box the productID would let you know whats in it an who ordered as well.

III.It is important to properly define your data types so you reduce if not eliminate the chance of redundancies and so you do not corrupt the data.

## **Big Data**

I.Volume- Is the amount of data..Referring to mass and quantity
Variety- Is the different types of data like time date and etc.
Veracity-Deals with the trustworthiness of the data.. Calculations biases and abnormalities.
Velocity- Represents the "motion" of the data and helps in making business decisions.

II. I would say the technology is streaming, social media and sports apps if not gambling ones increased the need for big data. With all the people using them in real time 
it would be a waste and they wouldnt know what exactly people wanted to see ,read,bet on or buy if they didnt.

## **Structured Query Langauge**
A.RDBMS stands for Relational database management systems its how all the info/data is stored and is also the basis for SQL and all modern database systems.

B.The two tables I chose are Order Details and Products. ProductID is the foreign key because it connects Products with Order Details since its in both columns and OrderID is the Primary Key.

## **SQL Injections**

B. SQL injection is a form of hacking where the hacker can gain access through the use of sql statements that can return a password value as true.
To avoid this you should use SQL parameters which are values that are added to the query in a controlled manner during the point of execution.

# **Ethical and Legal Implications**
## **Code of Ethics**
I.The purpose of a code of ethics is to give you guidlines and rules because as technology grows and your knowledge an experience it has the highest potential
to be abused. Especially with so much knowledge and information at your fingertips.

II.The difference between The Code of Ethics and The AUP is the code seems like it is meant for people who operate in a more professional capacity.
While with the AUP its more for your average user an closer to guidlines than anything else.

III. I looked at Marvel Comics AUP which is just their terms of use...They have quite a few pages and treat it as a contract. They speak to you about sharing your account, usage the introduction of malware and various other things. its quite extensive and even has a clause where they reserve the right to change what may or may not be acceptable.

## **Intellectual Property**
I. WIPO is a global forum for IP services.. Cooperation and information. They wish to develop a balanced international IP system that is also innovative, creative and can benefit all.

II.Your original work is already copywrote as soon as its written or drawn but if used commercially you would register with the US Copyright Office. Which is needed if you
found out your work has been stolen an plagairized if you plan on taking them to court.
 Which is why its important to copyright the image we created because if we dont and someone uses it we cant prove that it wasnt theirs to begin with and cannot seek legal action.
 
III. The role of a trademark is your brand image. It protects the consumer, it pretty much represents you and/or your company and having it (an defending it) keeps others from passing off their products as yours potentially defaming your name or saying your work is theirs.

## **Information Collection** 
COPPA- Coppa requires websites that gather information from children under the age of thirteen to comply and has them operate in the capacity that if a child is under the age of thirteen they need parental consent before collecting information.

FERPA- Protects the privacy of a students educational records and only allows access to their parents up until they are eighteen or starts college. it is mostly meant to keep
the dvhool from fidclosing their information improperly because of the digital times we're in.

HIPPA- Protects your healthcare records and gives you specific control over them and requires anyone with access to them to seek out your permission before disclosing them.


# **Conclusion**
Todays lesson was over SQL, data and information.. And about the policies that tell you not to abuse said information if it becomes available to you.
we covered a few organiztions and ways to track data.
