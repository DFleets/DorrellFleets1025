# **Executive Summary**

## **Data,Information and Knowledge**

## **Relational Data**
I. Data is considered raw facts deviod of context, while informstion is data that has been processed and now has purpose and relevance. 
knowledge is a human belief or perception about those concepts and facts.

II.1. If I was to do a table for customer and orders.. I would do an Customer#ID and use their phone number as a unique identifier so I can keep track and an OrderID 
which would be preassigned numbers to the shipments. An those would be my primary keys
ex: CustomerID: 4403454723 OrderID: 120054

2.The customer and order table would be related by a products table that would connect the person who ordered to the product to the shipment.


3. What would be the foreign key in the orders table would be a productID. like if the orderID is a box the productID would let you know whats in it an who ordered as well.

III.It is important to properly define your data types so you reduce if not eliminate the chance of redundancies and so you do not corrupt the data.

## **Big Data**

I.Volume- Is the amount of data..Referring to mass and quantity
Variety- Is the different types of data like time date and etc.
Veracity-Deals with the trustworthiness of the data.. Calculations biases and abnormalities.
Velocity- Represents the "motion" of the data and helps in making business decisions.

II. I would say the technology is streaming, social media and sports apps if not gambling ones increased the need for big data. With all the people using them in real time 
it would be a waste and they wouldnt know what exactly people wanted to see ,read,bet on or buy if they didnt.
