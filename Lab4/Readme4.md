# **Executive Summary**
In this chapter we will be covering GUIs and operating systems. 
Learning more about the interactive capabilities of a computer.

## **Operating Systems**

### **Python IDLE**
The difference between the shell and File editor is in shell you have '>>>' to prompt you on where to write. It also
runs one line of code at a time. 
In editor it doesnt contain the '>>>' and you are able to write continuous code before choosing to run it.

### **Code Examples**
1. a variable that can be used besides spam, eggs or bacon can be names like Alice, MyAge or Bob. Really anything as 
long as it follows the rules. which are It can only be one word. It can contain letters, numbers and an Underscore. Also it cannot begin with
a number. An example would be  Name_Variable32. 
The Author also uses the names Spam, Eggs and Bacon because it was inspired by Monty Python "Spam" sketch.

2.An assignment statement is when you store values in a variable. an example is when they assigned spam with a value of 40 by putting in
the line. 
spam = 40
So from that point the value 40 is being held in the word spam.

3. A function is used as a way to add or interact with the written code.
Examples are input(), print(), str(), int() and len()

4. Three data types are integers , strings and floating points.
A string pretty much can push anything through even a number like 6. But if you wanted to do math 
you would switch to a int() function for your integer Or use float() if your number contains a decimal point.  

## **Graphics**
A. In Raster format the pixels are usually too small to see until you zoom in.. BUt with Vector format you can make the image
larger or smaller without runining the image because it adjust with it.Also instead of pixels its rendered using special geometry.

B.Lossless is when all the data from the image compression is preserved, while lossy is when some of the original dats is removed reducing file size
of the image.

C.JPEG(Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a lossy compression format that allows the user to decide the amount of compression used.
Gif(Graphical Interchange Format) is a bitmap image format that is 8 bits per pixel and supports animations which neither of the other two can do.
PNG(Portable Network Graphics) is a bitmap image format that was made to replace Gif, supports 24 bits or 32 bits color. As well as being able to support transparency
options.

### **File Properties**
A.My image design is that of a storm cloud with a lightening bolt in the middle of a transparent circle. With designing logos I find simple and rememorable is usually best.

B.My image is about 30 KB and opens with PNG I wanted PNG because to me the outlining color stood out better and file size is still small. I probably could of did it with JPEG as well but the contrast lining looked like it suffered in my eyes.

# **Conclusion**
Today we touched on Python Code a little more and did some hands on training in graphic design. 
Making logos and manipulating file size to not waste unnessary space. 
Though seemingly simple to do. it would definitely take more practice to master.
