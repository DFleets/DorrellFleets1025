# **Executive Summary**
In this chapter we will be covering GUIs and operating systems. 
Learning more about the interactive capabilities of a computer.

## **Operating Systems**

### **Python IDLE**
The difference between the shell and File editor is in shell you have '>>>' to prompt you on where to write. It also
runs one line of code at a time. 
In editor it doesnt contain the '>>>' and you are able to write continuous code before choosing to run it.

### **Code Examples**
1. a variable that can be used besides spam, eggs or bacon can be names like Alice, MyAge or Bob. Really anything as 
long as it follows the rules. which are It can only be one word. It can contain letters, numbers and an Underscore. Also it cannot begin with
a number. An example would be  Name_Variable32. 
The Author also uses the names Spam, Eggs and Bacon because it was inspired by Monty Python "Spam" sketch.

2.An assignment statement is when you store values in a variable. an example is when they assigned spam with a value of 40 by putting in
the line. 
spam = 40
So from that point the value 40 is being held in the word spam.

3. A function is used as a way to add or interact with the written code.
Examples are input(), print(), str(), int() and len()

4. Three data types are integers , strings and floating points.
A string pretty much can push anything through even a number like 6. But if you wanted to do math 
you would switch to a int() function for your integer Or use float() if your number contains a decimal point.
