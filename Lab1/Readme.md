# **Executive Summary**
In this class IT1025 we will be covering the history of computers as well as building your familiarity with GitHub. 
which should help you build background knowledge of where computers came from along with a deeper understanding of them.
All while helping you build your working knowledge of GitHub.

# **Information System Components**
#### Android Smartphone
with the smartphone the hardware is the phone itself and it allows you(the user) to plug information in store it and send it to various other devices that can respond or store it as well.

#### Epic Teletracking System
epic teletracking is a system of patient logs with names and information to correctly identify who you will be picking up to transport. Upon arrival, departure and coming to your destination you notify the system which notifys The department that put in the call as well as your department heads so they can watch times and dispatch you to the next call accordingly. All in real time and ran off of an Apple IOS

#### Banking applications
Allow for keeping track of transactions and budgeting all while notifying you of any particular situation that may require your attention. Giving you the versatility to cancel change or stop anything with your account and relay the information back to the Bank or Teller without having to be present.

### Client-Server architecture
a client server architecture is a resource system in which the user(client) makes requests and the server responds to said request instead of a full transfer of information. Also able to check permissions to see which users had access to what resources and permissions. its also known as a service oriented architecture and as such service should never be disrupted.
GitHub desktop works as an app to simplify the process needed to access or manipulate your files. Through it you can use various commands that would make it easier overall to use instead of having to go to the site login in and go back and forth with the server to accomplish your goals.

### Cloud Computing
Git is considered cloud computing because it is a network of remote servers accessible to many users through the internet to store manage and process information rather than just on a PC or local server. Another example of this I believe is Amazon(AWS) and Unity.

# **Conclusion**
Today we covered the evolution of the computer, formation of the internet, and the use of GitHub as a client-server achitecture.Having not worked on this in years its still some adjustment and I did have to go over things a few times. But Im confident I will get the hang of it again, and look forward to continuing my exploration of IT.
